# FAQ

**I am unable to share a double-occupancy room. Can I still apply?**

Yes. Reasonable accommodations will be made where it is deemed necessary. Children under 18 years of
age must check in to the hotel with a parent or guardian and will not be assigned a roommate.

**Are any scholarship funds available to assist with the cost of traveling to and from the
convention?**

Unfortunately there are no scholarships available at this time to cover these expenses. We encourage
young organists to reach out to their local chapter and ask if any financial support may be
available to help with these costs!

Please note that the cost of transportation during the convention is part of the registration fee,
and therefore covered by the Houston scholarship.

**How will the funds be distributed?**

For both scholarships, payments will go directly from the fund to the convention or the hotel on the
recipient’s behalf. Recipients of the Houston scholarship will receive a personal code that they can
use to register for the convention. Please note that any “extras” you add on to your registration
(such as excursions or additional meals) will be at your own cost.

**I am eligible for both scholarships. Can I apply for both?**

No. If we receive two applications from you, only the first one received will be considered. We
encourage applicants who are eligible for both to apply for the Houston scholarship.
