# Land Acknowledgement

The Steering Committee for the SF AGO convention acknowledges that we are on the unceded ancestral
homeland of the Ramaytush Ohlone who are the original inhabitants of the San Francisco Peninsula.
The Ramaytush Ohlone are the indigenous stewards of this land and in accordance with their
traditions, they have not forgotten their responsibilities as the caretakers of this place, as
well as for all peoples who reside in their traditional territory. As guests, we recognize that we
benefit from living and working on their traditional homeland. We pay our respects by acknowledging
the ancestors, elders and relatives of the Ramaytush Community and by affirming their sovereign
rights as First Peoples.
