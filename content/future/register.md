Consider extending your stay! The AGO group hotel rate of $169 per night is available both before
and after the convention dates, from June 23 through July 10. Before and after the convention, take
the opportunity to enjoy San Francisco sights, neighborhoods, and restaurants, as well as sports
events, museums, shopping, and concerts. And this year SF Pride is June 29–30, 2024.

Please note that registration fees include bus transportation from the hotel to most convention
venues, a $150–$200 value. While door-to-door bus service is provided whenever possible, at
times attendees will need to walk several blocks. **If you are unable to do so or if you need ADA
transportation, be sure to check the special needs box when you register.**

Not an AGO member? It's not too late to join and take advantage of member rates. Simply complete your
