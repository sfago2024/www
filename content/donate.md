The San Francisco AGO Steering Committee is pleased to partner with you to bring
the 2024 convention to life. Producing a convention of this caliber is a
collective effort, and our supporters play an essential role. Registration fees
combined with support from AGO National and chapters cover 60% of convention
costs. The balance is contributed by generous supporters who share our love for
the organists, the music, and the instrument.

Your contribution, at any level, helps cover substantial costs that exceed
regular registration fees. Your partnership with us brings a stunning, diverse
lineup of performers, new music, worship experiences, workshops, and world-class
venues to life.
