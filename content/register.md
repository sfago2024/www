Consider extending your stay! The AGO group hotel rate of $169 per night is available both before
and after the convention dates, from June 27 through July 7, subject to availability. Before
and after the convention, take the opportunity to enjoy San Francisco sights, neighborhoods, and
restaurants, as well as sports events, museums, shopping, and concerts. And this year SF Pride is
June 29–30, 2024.

Please note that registration fees include bus transportation from the hotel to most convention
venues, a $150–$200 value. While door-to-door bus service is provided whenever possible, at
times attendees will need to walk several blocks. **If you are unable to do so or if you need ADA
transportation, be sure to check the special needs box when you register.**

Not an AGO member? It's not too late to join and take advantage of member rates. Simply complete your
{% external_link(href="https://www.agohq.org/membership/membership-comparisons-dues-rates/") %}membership or renewal{% end %}
application to secure the reduced rate for the convention.
