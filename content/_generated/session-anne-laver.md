She has performed in Europe, Scandinavia, Africa and across the United States and has been a featured recitalist at conventions of the American Guild of Organists, the Organ Historical Society, the Westfield Center for Historical Keyboard Studies, and the Göteborg International Organ Academy (Sweden). In 2010, she was awarded second prize in the AGO National Young Artist Competition in Organ Performance (NYACOP). Anne’s debut recording, “Reflections of Light” (Loft, 2019) received favorable reviews and has been aired on nationally syndicated radio programs, including WXXI FM’s With Heart and Voice and American Public Media’s Pipedreams. \r\n\r\nAn advocate for new music and diversifying the organ repertoire, Anne has worked with composer Natalie Draper to offer programs for composers who want to write for the organ, and has given world premieres of works by Draper, Eric Heumann, Jordan Alexander Key, and Ivan Božičević. As a scholar, Anne’s research interests focus on organ music at the nineteenth and twentieth century world’s fairs. Her articles have been published in the Journal for the Society of American Music, Vox Humana, and The American Organist. \r\n\r\nIn her appointment as Associate Professor of Organ and University Organist at Syracuse University’s Setnor School of Music, she helps educate the next generation of organists. Anne also has taught and led outreach programs at the Eastman School of Music, most recently serving as Visiting Professor of Organ from 2020-2022. \r\n\r\nAnne is grateful for her teachers, Jacqueline Cratin Smith, Mark Steinbach, Jacques van Oortmerssen, Hans Davidsson, William Porter, and David Higgs.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please visit annelaver.com', speaker_display_name='Anne Laver', speaker_first_name='Anne', speaker_last_name='Laver', speaker_stub='DF5790FB-1F67-4F18-B30A-CFA3337CD1E8', speaker_title='', updated_date=datetime.date(2023, 9, 4)), updated=False, deleted=False)></li>
