<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Timothy Howard is Director of Music and Organist at Pasadena Presbyterian Church, and Lecturer in Music at California State University, Northridge. At PPC he directs two adult choirs, is Artistic Director of the churchâ€™s Friends of Music concert series, and oversees a professional staff of 11. At CSUN he heads the schoolâ€™s organ program, teaches music theory and analysis, musicianship, performance practice and other courses; has also conducted the Universityâ€™s Wind Symphony and Womenâ€™s Chorale. A graduate, with honors, from the University of Southern California with a Doctor of Musical Arts degree, Dr. Howard also holds degrees from Westminster Choir College and Biola University.  Dr. Howard has been an advocate for excellence in hymn playing since his first church organist post at age 13. Recognizing the power of congregational song and the ability of the organist to â€œshape the moment,â€ he has devoted much energy to refining the appropriate skills to guide the congregation through a hymn.  In addition to his work as a service player, Dr. Howard is recognized by both colleagues and the public as an insightful solo and collaborative performer. He has been featured soloist for the Los Angeles Bach Festival and the Corona del Mar Baroque Music Festival, and has played with the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, the Los Angeles Philharmonicâ€™s Green Umbrella group and the Los Angeles Master Chorale, in addition to the concerto and solo appearances for PPCâ€™s Friends of Music concerts. His live performances of his organ scores for Nosferatu and From the Manger to the Cross have become popular with audiences.</p>
