In addition to his work as a service player, Dr. Howard is recognized by both colleagues and the public as an insightful solo and collaborative performer. He has been featured soloist for the Los Angeles Bach Festival and the Corona del Mar Baroque Music Festival, and has played with the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, the Los Angeles Philharmonicâ€™s Green Umbrella group and the Los Angeles Master Chorale, in addition to the concerto and solo appearances for PPCâ€™s Friends of Music concerts.

While many excellent published reharmonizations are available, the imaginative organist might want to explore ways of creating their own. This workshop introduces “progressive reharmonization,” a method of modifying and adding harmonic elements to a standard (hymnal) harmonization while avoiding chords that might confuse the singers. Topics covered will include the principles of traditional harmonic progression, how to introduce chords and non-harmonic elements that intensify those progressions, and how to use chords with harmonic extensions.

Too often, hymn playing can slip into mediocrity (leading the singing right along with it) when the organist only learns and executes the notes while not taking other important issues into account. This workshop presents a set of practical principles and achievable objectives you can use to help address those issues and turn ordinary hymn playing into an extraordinary experience for everyone.
