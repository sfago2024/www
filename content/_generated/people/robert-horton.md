<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Robert Horton, DMA serves as Director of Music at Holy Trinity Lutheran Church in Lancaster, PA.  Prior to his appointment at Trinity, he served as Interim Chapel Organist at Duke University and as Director of Music at Saint Mark's Episcopal Church (Evanston, IL).  From 2005 until 2008, Dr. Horton served as Director of Keyboard Studies at Dordt College (Sioux Center, IA) where he taught sacred music, history, solfege and directed the college jazz band.  Dr. Horton hails from Rhode Island and holds degrees from Cornell, Northwestern, and Kansas University. As a Fulbright scholar, he studied at the Conservatoire National de RÃ©gion (Toulouse) and visited the finest historic instruments in France.  Along the way, he has benefited from the counsel of such renowned pedagogues as James Higdon, David Craighead, Karel Paukert and Michel Bouvard. A relative latecomer to the arts, Dr. Horton worked quickly to establish himself as an organist, garnering numerous accolades, including highest honors at the 2007 Mikael Tariverdiev Competition (Kaliningrad, Russia) as well as 1st prize at the 2022 AGO National Improvisation Competition.</p>
