<h1>Mindfulness and Spiritual Wellbeing for Church Musicians</h1>
<h2>Date/Time</h2>
<p>Sunday, June 30, 2024<br>
12:00 PM – 01:00 PM (Pacific Time)</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
(not implemented yet)
<h2>Description</h2>
Participatory exploration of ways to stay mentally & spiritually healthy in our profession

We will discuss several aspects of wellness as they pertain to our careers as church musicians. Mindfulness techniques will be taught as a way to promote better performance and mental health, especially in a high-pressure, high performance field such as music. We will also explore the importance of community and outside hobbies to keep balance in life. 

Then we will shift to spiritual health as another facet of wellness of the whole person. How can we as church musicians find balance between our work and our own spirituality? What if we don’t agree or connect with the church in which we work but still seek spiritual fulfillment? Participants will have the opportunity to share and discuss how they take care of their own mental and spiritual wellness.
