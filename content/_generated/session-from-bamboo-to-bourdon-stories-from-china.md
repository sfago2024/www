<h1>From Bamboo to Bourdon: Stories from China</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The organ acts as a storyteller for 19th and 20th century Chinese composers

Napoleon Bonaparte said, “Let China sleep, for when she wakes, she will shake the world.” On the other side of the world lies a country full of unheard stories. These stories have the power to shake the world, and there’s no better instrument to bring those stories across the Pacific than the organ. 

The organ will serve as a link between Eastern and Western traditions. Even though the body of Chinese music written for the organ is quite small, the instrument’s diverse array of sounds enables us to explore Chinese music written for orchestra, keyboard, and traditional Chinese instruments. 

Rather than focusing on the history of the pipe organ in China, this session will focus on 19th and 20th century Chinese composers and their stories. Attendees will learn about these composers and the forces that shaped their pieces, and after each piece is introduced, Ms. Chiu will perform it. 

Attendees will not only walk away from this session with an increased knowledge of Chinese music and culture, but also an increased desire to diversify their repertoire. We will delve into how YOU can expand the organ literature. Both the stories you’ll hear and your personal stories have the power to shake the world.
