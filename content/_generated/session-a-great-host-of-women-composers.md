<h2>Description</h2>
a survey of sacred music by a great host of women

From Fall 2020 through Spring 2023, A Great Host team of eight from diverse spots in the USA and England curated a database of sacred choral music by women composers for the three-year Revised Common Lectionary, viewable from www.greathostcomposers.org. This workshop, from the founder of A Great Host, surveys the origin of the project and its name, and highlights historical and contemporary sacred works of the database. St. Paul’s Episcopal Church, Burlingame, CA is offered as an example of introducing women composers to a small parish, from a composer timeline to commissions and an annual concert. A closing discussion looks to the continued goals of A Great Host, from Women’s History Month to all twelve months, from a specialized list to an integrated catalogue.
