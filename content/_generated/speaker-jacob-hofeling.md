<ul><li><bound method Session.link of Session(data=SessionData(session_description='Learn about using your iPad to store your sheet music, turn pages "hands and feet free" and more.\r\n\r\nWith ForScore, storing and reading sheet music has never been easier. This application for iOS allows users to store hundreds of thousands of scores, easily search and sort your music, and perform the music effectively in a live setting. Newer versions of iPads will even allow you to turn the page with simply a nod of the head. This workshop will focus on the process of taking your hard copy of a score, scanning each page and importing it into ForScore. From there, the music is given a label and appropriate tags. That music can then be put into a setlist and arranged in order with other scores. ForScore\'s features include a built in metronome, audio recording capability, and shortcuts that can take you from any score to a specific page in the same score or a different score with the push of a button. ForScore allows you to mark, highlight, or write finger numbers or pedal markings into the score with a touch of your finger, and these markings can be easily erased. If you have an iPad, and you would like to incorporate it more into your music, this workshop will help you take those crucial steps into digitizing your library. With ForScore, you can carry your entire sheet music library with you at all times, and also backup those files so they will never be lost.', session_end_date_time=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 1, 13, 0), session_name='From iPad to Organ - Tech Tips', session_start_date_time=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 1, 12, 0), session_stub='17FA3401-3859-4428-8840-4E2B1906CBAF', speaker_category=['Organist'], speakers=['64005181-5119-4929-9F90-F85426DC356D'], timezone_name='Pacific Time', updated_date=datetime.date(2023, 9, 4)), updated=False, deleted=False)></li><li><bound method Session.link of Session(data=SessionData(session_description='Discover technology to store music, easily turn pages, and more on a tablet or iPad. \r\n\r\nThe rapidly changing world of technology can be an incredible asset to organists. You may have seen an increase in other musicians using tablets or other devices to read scores and mark scores and quickly turn pages. These tools can make playing the organ more efficient and can drastically reduce the amount of sheet music you carry with you on a regular basis. This workshop class will focus on the applications available for scanning and storing sheet music on a digital device, the applications available to view and perform music in real time, and devices that can help you turn pages with ease. With applications like ForScore and MobileSheets, you can store tens of thousands of scores, organize your digital libraries, and even highlight and mark your scores. You can easily search your array of collected scores by whatever criteria you choose, such as genre, key, composer, or any other user-defined tags. Beside sheet music reading, there are applications and devices for a variety of other uses, including metronomes, practice journals, audio and video recording, and virtual meeting software for teaching or taking lessons remotely. We will also examine note writing software, digital audio workstations for recording and editing music, and composition applications that can be used anywhere. We will broadly look at the available landscape of technology that helps organists focus on what matters most; making music effectively.', session_end_date_time=datetime.datetime(2024, 6, 30, 13, 0), session_name='Getting Organized with Technology', session_start_date_time=datetime.datetime(2024, 6, 30, 12, 0), session_stub='29EFBAE1-2001-47C6-A2A7-481F75525456', speaker_category=['Organist'], speakers=['64005181-5119-4929-9F90-F85426DC356D'], timezone_name='Pacific Time', updated_date=datetime.date(2023, 9, 4)), updated=False, deleted=False)></li>
