<h2>Description</h2>
Panel participants from AGO and SWO discuss advocacy efforts supporting women musicians.

All are welcome to join us for this panel discussion about the remarkable work of two organizations that both had their roots in the pandemic, and now have hundreds of followers. Come and find out what we have accomplished since spring of 2020, learn about our future goals, and get a quick rundown of some of our favorite works by women composers. In addition, we will address the problem of accessibility of music by women, we will hear from SWO members about the progress on their Adjustable Bench Campaign, and end with a Q&A: What are your concerns? And how can we help?
