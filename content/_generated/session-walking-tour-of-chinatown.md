<div class="ag87-crtemvc-hsbk"><div class="css-vsf5of"><p class="carina-rte-public-DraftStyleDefault-block">San Francisco’s Chinatown rose from the ashes of the 1906 earthquake to evolve into a Chinese community holding fast to its traditions amid a rapidly changing cityscape. Discover the local alleys where this community has continued to flourish for over 150 years, in spite of harsh racial discrimination.&nbsp; Family associations and temples, dim sum, herbal apothecaries and jade jewelry shops built by the local community, all contribute to the vibrancy of this place, one of the oldest Chinese communities outside of China.</p><p class="carina-rte-public-DraftStyleDefault-block"><span style="color: rgb(128,0,0);"><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> This is a 3-hour activity.</span></p></div></div>
