This workshop will explore improvisation techniques of Charles Tournemire and Olivier Messiaen

The 1930’s were a fertile period for French organ music and improvisation. Jeffrey Brillhart will introduce techniques used by Charles Tournemire and Olivier Messiaen to expand your repertoire of ideas for improvisation. Included will be creative uses of pedal points, ostinatos, harmonization with seconds, thirds and seconds, and Messiaen’s limited modes of transposition.
