<h2>Date/Time</h2>

<h2>Location</h2>
(not implemented yet)
<h2>Description</h2>
Little time, great efficiency! How to rehearse with integrated vocal technique and a strong mindset.

- We will explore how even basic vocal knowledge and its constructive application solves 90% of problems for choir conductors and their choristers within their weekly rehearsals (How to solve that top B flat without sopranos going flat)

- We will go into how specific instruction from conductors to choristers can lift the respective level of one's choir immediately. (And what NOT to say to my choir ...)

- We will learn how to raise the demands on our choir groups, starting only with ourselves. What does my own preparation look like? The Seven Swedish Pillars of Score Studies. (Never a dull moment!)

- Training of choristers is mental training and leadership training. How do I as a leader raise the consciousness in my singers, also when I'm perhaps a little insecure or nervous? Some magic tricks for happy, confident and efficient communication. (Don't tell them what you just did!)
