<h2>Description</h2>

During this three-part workshop series we'll cover common (inefficient) postural, tension & breath patterns among organists through self-myofascial release and gentle movement sequences.   Postural / tension / breath patterns covered will include: shoulder & upper back rounding, forward head posture, lower back tension, head / neck / face tension, shallow breathing, abdominal clenching and more.  This workshop series will give organists simple, easily replicable exercises they can integrate into their regular practice routine to maintain efficient posture and reduce stiffness / discomfort while playing the organ.
