<h2>Description</h2>

This will be a demonstration of the Hupalo & Repasky Tudor organ at Stanford, along with an insight into the performance of the exquisite repertoire from pre-Reformation England. The combination of many sources of keyboard music from that time, along with the lack of any surviving instruments has long been an enigma. This demonstration will feature some of this music as well as the process of the construction of this beautiful instrument.
