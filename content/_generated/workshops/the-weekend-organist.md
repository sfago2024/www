<h2>Description</h2>

Are you a weekend organist? Many part-time church musicians must do more with less – rehearsal time, budgets, volunteers, smaller instruments – all while still creating a dynamic worship experience and balancing a day job. In this reading session, J.W. Arnold, author of “The Weekend Organist” column in The American Organist magazine, will lead a review and discussion of both new and trusted organ music, worship collections, choral anthems, and other resources. Most importantly, you’ll have the opportunity to share the tips and tricks that you’ve developed in your own part-time music ministry.
