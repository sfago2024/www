<h2>Description</h2>
Learn practical principles and achievable objectives to enliven your hymn playing.

Guiding a congregation to its corporate musical voice is one of an organist’s most important tasks, and how we approach playing hymns—the peoples’ music—is central to that. Too often, hymn playing can slip into mediocrity (leading the singing right along with it) when the organist only learns and executes the notes while not taking other important issues into account. This workshop presents a set of practical principles and achievable objectives you can use to help address those issues and turn ordinary hymn playing into an extraordinary experience for everyone. Topics covered will include tempo, phrasing, how “accuracy” and “perception” work together (or not), articulation, registration and more.
