<h2>Description</h2>
Women’s organ music from eight centuries, with tales of the pressures the composers overcame.

Women composers are at last beginning to emerge from centuries of neglect. With publications of their works slowly appearing, it is now possible for all organists to include music by women in concerts, services, and teaching.  Oxford University Press’s new publication, the Oxford Book of Organ Music by Women Composers, includes music from the 16th century to the present day, with pieces suitable for intermediate to advanced organists.   Anne Marsden Thomas will illustrate many of the pieces and tell the composers’ stories: the educational, domestic, social, and professional pressures they overcame and their struggles to be published.   Finally, she will highlight further opportunities for discovering organ music by women.
