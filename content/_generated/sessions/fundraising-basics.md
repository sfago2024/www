AGO chapters are faced with many of the same financial challenges shared by other organizations, both for profit and not for profit.

If you are involved in balancing your chapter’s annual budget or expect to be in the future, this workshop is for you. Various avenues for obtaining annual and project support will be discussed and planned giving opportunities will be explored.
