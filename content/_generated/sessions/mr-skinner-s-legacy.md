<h1>Mr. Skinner’s Legacy</h1>

<h2>Date/Time</h2>
<p>Monday, July 01, 2024<br>
10:00 AM – 10:45 AM</p>
<h2>Description</h2>

We will examine in detail eight characteristics of E.M. Skinner’s work and how they have influenced today’s organ building. A thumbnail biography, reading list and personal anecdotes will introduce this fascinating character to those who only know Mr. Skinner by the sound of his instruments. Sure to arouse some controversy is Mr. Bethards’ thesis that twelve characteristics put Skinner in the “Super-Star” category above all the master builders of the Romantic Era except Henry Willis and Aristide Cavaillé-Coll. We will see what made these three legendary figures stand out.
