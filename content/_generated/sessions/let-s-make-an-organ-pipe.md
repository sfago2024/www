<h1>Let's Make an Organ Pipe</h1>

<h2>Date/Time</h2>
<p>Wednesday, July 03, 2024<br>
03:00 PM â€“ 03:45 PM</p>
<h2>Description</h2>

Time to make some sawdust! Dr. Robert Horton (Lancaster, PA) demonstrates the construction of a basic wooden organ pipe. Using simple materials, we will introduce the technical language and mathematical basis of pipe construction, learning firsthand how the several dimensions of an organ pipe affect its sound. Hands-on audience participation is welcome and one participant will take home a souvenir pipe.
