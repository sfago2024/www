<h2>Description</h2>
Explore ideas for engaging young people in learning to play the organ.

The pipe organ is probably the most fascinating instrument in the world! It is awe-inspiring and majestic. Put a young person at the helm letting them explore the array of sounds available at their fingertips and feet and they will be instantly hooked. In this workshop, discover tricks that will entice youth and children to try the organ!
The AGO offers programs such as Pedals, Pipes and Pizza and Pipe Organ Encounters to give youth a chance to interact with the pipe organ.  Chapter scholarship programs can offer a way to nurture young students by not only providing education but also building a sense of community through social activities and giving them opportunities to showcase their success in student recitals. Find out how your chapter can successfully implement these programs as well as workshops and summer organ camps. Today’s budding organists will become the future generations that keep this wonderful art of organ playing alive!
