<h1>How to perform brilliantly</h1>
<h2>Date/Time</h2>

<h2>Description</h2>
Identifying successful practice and performance strategies

Why do so many organists find it hard to perform brilliantly?  Whether the performance is spoiled by wayward limbs, habitual or new errors, self-doubt or distracting mind-games, the cause is probably the same: poorly chosen repertoire coupled with imperfect practice methods.  The workshop addresses all these performance problems in turn, showing how effective training of a well-chosen piece inspires the player, builds confidence and concentration and results in a reliable and brilliant performance.
