<h2>Description</h2>
How to protect yourself against harassment in academic and work environments

Our awareness of harassment of all kinds has moved to the forefront over the past few years.  And unfortunately, harassment can affect anyone, not being limited to any one group of people. Whether it is at work, in the classroom or the studio,  we are often afraid to say or do something for fear of reprisal.  Or, we don't even know where to turn for help.  This workshop will discuss best practices to recognize harassment and resources to protect ourselves, and hopefully begin to stop the cycle of abuse.
