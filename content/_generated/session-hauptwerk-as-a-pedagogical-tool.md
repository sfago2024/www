<h1>Hauptwerk as a Pedagogical Tool</h1>
<h2>Date/Time</h2>
<p>Sunday, June 30, 2024<br>
12:00 PM â€“ 01:00 PM (Pacific Time)</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
An exploration of ways virtual sampling instruments can enhance learning at all levels!

In the past few years Hauptwerk and other virtual sampling technologies have surged onto the organ landscape. In 2017 Southwestern Adventist University in Keene, TX acquired a custom Noorlander console with 14 organ sample sets for the pedagogical and practice opportunities of their students. This workshop seeks to share the unique ways this affordable resource can contribute to vibrant and comprehensive learning at all levels and experience! Topics covered will include roles & benefits in learning environments, basic cost analysis and comparisons, setup and maintenance concerns, and a handout of resources.
