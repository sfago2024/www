An introduction to the fascinating historic pipe organs of Transylvania, Romania

This workshop, co-presented by concert organist Renée Anne Louprette and organ builder Árpád Magyar, will present a summary of Ms. Louprette’s 2022 Fulbright research project surveying historic pipe organs throughout Romania. Ms. Louprette will share findings from her project focusing on the culturally diverse region of Transylvania and the fascinating instruments from the Baroque period through the 19th century that have been rescued and masterfully restored by artisans of the C.O.T. organ building firm and training school in Hărman, Brașov. Mr. Magyar, co-owner and manager of the C.O.T. firm that celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2023, will highlight aspects of the firm’s remarkable development and the challenges and rewards of recent restoration projects. The workshop will feature audio and video recordings as well as detailed photography captured by Ms. Louprette as part of her exploration of this precious cultural heritage of Eastern Europe.
