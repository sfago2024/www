<p>Robert Horton, DMA serves as Director of Music at Holy Trinity Lutheran Church in Lancaster, PA.  Prior to his appointment at Trinity, he served as Interim Chapel Organist at Duke University and as Director of Music at Saint Mark's Episcopal Church (Evanston, IL).

Dr. Horton hails from Rhode Island and holds degrees from Cornell, Northwestern, and Kansas University.
