<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Soprano Sara LeMesh, hailed by the San Francisco Chronicle for her “powerhouse performance of vocal majesty and expressive translucency,” is a dramatic presence on the opera stage, an avid chamber musician, and an advocate of contemporary music. She was recently a resident artist with Opera Naples where she performed the role of Josephine in Gilbert and Sullivan’s H.M.S. Pinafore (February 2022). Also at Opera Naples, she sang the roles of Frasquita in Bizet’s Carmen (March 2023) and Woman #1 in Robert Xavier Rodriguez’s Frida (April 2023). In addition, she recently appeared in several concerts with the Southwest Florida Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Radu Paponiu (April 2023).

A devoted recitalist, LeMesh recently made her debut with the Jupiter Symphony Chamber Players singing Fauré's La bonne chanson and Chausson's Chanson perpétuelle (October 2022). LeMesh was also selected as a Semi-Finalist in the 2023 Washington International Competition for Voice where she prepared a recital program featuring works by American composers.

LeMesh has performed throughout the United States and Europe at venues and festivals including The Morgan Library & Museum, Aspen Music Festival, Tanglewood Music Center, Music Academy of the West, American Bach Soloists, and International Summer Academy of the Mozarteum Salzburg. With pianist Allegra Chapman, LeMesh performs in the piano-vocal duo Chordless. In February 2020, the duo produced a “heartbreakingly beautiful” (San Francisco Chronicle) music video for the final movement of George Crumb's Apparition. The film received international recognition and was an official selection in the Tokyo International Short Film Festival and Montreal Independent Film Festival. It was also a finalist in the Seattle Film Festival and Hudson Valley Film Fest. LeMesh received her MM from the Bard College-Conservatory of Music and a BM from Rice University.</p>
