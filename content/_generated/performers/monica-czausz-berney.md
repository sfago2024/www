<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>A true star among young classical musicians, Monica Berney, née Czausz, has made a name for herself as one of the finest organists on the scene today. Known for her technical mastery, effortless musicality, and engaging stage presence, she has been inspiring audiences from coast to coast with “artistic mastery far beyond her years” (The American Organist). 

She has performed at significant venues across the United States, including Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, the Meyerson Symphony Center in Dallas, Merrill Auditorium in Portland (Maine,) the Kimmel Center in Philadelphia, and Spivey Hall in Morrow (Georgia). She has been featured at numerous Regional Conventions of the American Guild of Organists (North Central, Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, Southwest, and Northeast), as well as online Organfest in 2019 and the 2017 National Convention in Houston, as Evensong Organist and “Rising Star.” She has performed at several National Conventions of the Organ Historical Society, in Minneapolis/St. Paul (2017), Philadelphia (2016) where she “played with great flair” (The American Organist), and western Massachusetts (2015). She also performed at the 2016 East Texas Pipe Organ Festival where The Tracker reported, “this young lady just blew us all away.”
