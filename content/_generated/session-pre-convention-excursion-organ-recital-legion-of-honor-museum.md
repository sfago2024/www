<h1>Pre-Convention Excursion & Organ Recital: Legion of Honor Museum</h1>
<h2>Date/Time</h2>
<p>Saturday, June 29, 2024<br>
02:00 PM – 05:00 PM (Pacific Time)</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<div class="ag87-crtemvc-hsbk"><div class="css-vsf5of"><p class="carina-rte-public-DraftStyleDefault-block">Don’t miss this unique opportunity to visit San Francisco’s Legion of Honor on Saturday, June 29. A bus will leave the hotel at 2PM and whisk you over to Lincoln Park to spend the afternoon in this wonderful space. The Legion opened in 1924 and its website describes it as home to “American art from the 17th century through today, textile arts and costumes, African art, Oceanic art, arts of the Americas, and international contemporary art.” The summer exhibition running then will be “Japanese Prints in Transition: From the Floating World to the Modern World.” For organists, an added bonus is that it is also home to the magnificent Spreckels Organ, built by the Ernest M. Skinner that opening year. Legion architect George Applegarth worked with Skinner to situate the instrument in the most imaginative way possible. Not only will you see it, but you’ll get to hear a free organ recital at 4 p.m. that afternoon by Legion resident organist Jonathan Dimmock, including <span style="font-style: italic;">Appalachian Triptych</span> by David Hegarty, and music by Copland, Elgar, Halley, and Vaughan Williams.</p></div></div>
