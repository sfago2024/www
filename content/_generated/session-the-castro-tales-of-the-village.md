<h2>Description</h2>
<div class="ag87-crtemvc-hsbk"><div class="css-vsf5of"><p class="carina-rte-public-DraftStyleDefault-block"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">When Harvey Milk won his historic 1977 race for the Board of Supervisors, he ran the campaign out of his humble Castro District camera shop. For the past decade, a vibrant gay community had been taking root in the Castro—one that would come to transform San Francisco politics out of sheer collective willpower. You’ll learn about the evolution of the Castro’s architecture, historic businesses, and the people and places that played a role in making the Castro one of the epicenters of the gay rights movement—a tradition that continues to this day.</span></p></div></div>
