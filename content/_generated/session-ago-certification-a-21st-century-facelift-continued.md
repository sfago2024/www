<h2>Location</h2>

<h2>Description</h2>
A much-anticipated update to the Guild's certification program.

It has been no secret that the Committee on Professional Certification has been very hard at work in updating many parts of the exam experience for the AGO. Our applications are now done online, a new Examination Hymn Booklet has been produced, the repertoire has all been updated to reflect greater diversity, ear tests are now done by recording, our prize money has been substantially increased and we have provided online webinar training for candidates.

Come join us as we explore some of the next steps in this final phase of the “facelift” for the certification program.This past year we have updated the Manuals of Procedure for all exams, engaged more with the Board of Examiners to standardize grading, completed the digitization of the exam grading process for SPC and CAGO, reached out to academic programs for greater collaboration, and initiated a new mentorship initiative as well as study groups.
