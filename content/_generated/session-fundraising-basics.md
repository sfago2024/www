<h2>Description</h2>
The Dollars and Sense It Takes to Raise Money for Your Chapter

AGO chapters are faced with many of the same financial challenges shared by other organizations, both for profit and not for profit. This workshop is designed to empower chapter leaders with some of the basic skills needed to seek and obtain funding for chapter programs and events and will highlight the importance of donor cultivation, stewardship, and acknowledgements. If you are involved in balancing your chapter’s annual budget or expect to be in the future, this workshop is for you. Various avenues for obtaining annual and project support will be discussed and planned giving opportunities will be explored.
