<h2>Description</h2>
An interdisciplinary study on Messiaen's synesthesia and the effect on his compositional harmony.

Meditations on the Nativity is an interdisciplinary presentation of Messiaen's synesthesia in relation to his unique harmony. Using "La Nativité", this workshop will explore the color relations as outlined in his treatise "Traité de rythme, de couleur, et d’ornithologie: (1949-1992)" and demonstrate the experience of the analysis in real time with a video recorded light show analysis as well as a through a collection of interpretation of fine art as created by Olivia Wiering. Themes of Messiaen's faith and compositional harmony will be studied in how they relate to his unique condition that influenced his body of work.
