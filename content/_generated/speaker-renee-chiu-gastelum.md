<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Chinese Hispanic organist and Silicon Valley native Renee Chiu enjoys a blossoming career as a performer, educator, and speaker. She became a Colleague of the AGO at age 19 and an Associate at age 22. Ms. Chiu graduated Cum Laude with a Bachelor’s Degree of Organ Performance from Brigham Young University, which she earned under the tutelage of Drs. Don Cook and Neil Harmon. She is currently a Master’s candidate there. 

Ms. Chiu volunteered in community outreach projects in Taiwan from 2019-2020, where she became fluent in Mandarin. Upon returning to the United States, she taught Mandarin and then established her own private piano/organ studio.
