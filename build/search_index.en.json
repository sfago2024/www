After graduating from the monastery school in Engelberg, he studied music at the Zurich Conservatory, graduating with a soloist's diploma in piano and organ. \nWhen studying in London with Kendall Taylor (piano) and Richard Latham (organ) in 1976, he became particularly fascinated by English choral singing, which inspired him to write several works for choir a cappella. A recording of his ten-part Rilke motets by the BBC Singers and their broadcast on the BBC in 1982 launched his career as a composer.\nHe composed a number of predominantly religious choral works: a Requiem commissioned by the London Bach Choir in 2007, the 40-part motet Veni Creator Spiritus, a Magnificat, a Stabat Mater, and Alpha et Omega premiered by the BBC Symphony Chorus at the 1999 BBC PROMS, and collaborated with many choirs, also in the U.S., such as San Francisco Symphony Chorus, St. Louis Chamber Chorus, Mon Choeur Indianapolis, and the Choir of St. Francis in the Fields (Louisville, Kentucky) which gave the U.S. premiere of his Requiem in 2009.\nHis compositions also include the Christmas carol I wonder as I wander, which has been performed many times by the Choir of King’s College Cambridge in their Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols and broadcast all over the world. \nThe fact that Sir Stephen Cleobury even commissioned him in 2014 to write the annual new carol (De Virgine Maria) for the festival was a huge honor for Rütti as a non-English composer.\nIn addition to composing for choirs, Carl Rütti also wrote an enormous number of instrumental works, such as three organ concertos, many works for solo organ and chamber music, Montreux Wind Dances (for wind orchestra), Book of Hours for solo piano, a concerto for three pianos and orchestra (premiered by Carl Rütti and his two sons), a concerto for alphorn and strings and the oratorio Mysterium Montis for six alphorns, four soloists and choir.\nIn 2015 Carl Rütti was awarded the Orlando-di-Lasso-Medal.\nRütti has been the organist at St. Peter and Paul’s church in Oberägeri/Zug for more than 40 years.\nwww.ruettimusic.ch\n","id":"https://www.sfago2024.org/composers/carl-rütti/","path":"/composers/carl-rütti/","title":"Carl Rütti"},"https://www.sfago2024.org/composers/david-conte/":{"body":"David Conte\n\nBiography\nDavid Conte has received commissions from Chanticleer; the San Francisco, Dayton, Oakland, and Stockton Symphonies; the Raymond Brock Commission from the American Choral Directors Association; and for conventions of the AGO (2004, 2012, 2015, 2024).

He earned a BM from Bowling Green State University where he studied with Wallace DePue, and an MFA and DMA from Cornell University where he studied with Karel Husa.  In 1982 Conte worked with Aaron Copland preparing a study of the composer’s manuscript sketches. \nHe has taught at Cornell, Colgate University, the American Conservatory in Fontainebleau, France, and Interlochen.

Championed by legendary conductors from Riccardo Muti, Michael Tilson Thomas, Marin Alsop, and Leonard Slaktin, his symphonic music is the first to receive widespread acceptance for its unique integration of electronic sounds. Named as the most-performed composer of his generation in a recent survey of American music, Bates has also composed for feature film, including Gus Van Sant’s The Sea of Trees starring Matthew McConaughey and Naomi Watts, and Philharmonia Fantastique, the soundtrack of which was awarded a 2022 Grammy Award.\n\tThis season features the premiere of Nomad Concerto for violinist Gil Shaham with the Philadelphia Orchestra under the baton of Yannick Nezen-Seguin.  Co-commissioned by Nashville Symphony and San Diego Symphony, the concerto explores the rich music of travelers, particularly Europe’s ‘music of the Roma’ with its blend of soul and rhythm.

Drawing on his affinity for humor, his background in science, and his fascination with everyday experiences, Kim’s work radiates positivity, offering “major-league cuteness” (Broadway World) while demonstrating “surprising scope.” (San Diego Story) As a Korean-American, Kim explores the localization of imported traditions, incorporating cross-cultural elements into his work in “impressive and special” ways so that “many orchestras and conductors around the world are taking an interest in [his] music.” (KPBS) By highlighting the interaction between folk culture and external influences, Kim creates meaningful depth while maintaining playfulness and exuberance that is listener-friendly and engaging.\nAn impressive roster of international ensembles has programmed Kim’s music, including the New York Philharmonic, San Francisco Symphony, San Francisco Opera Orchestra, Minnesota Orchestra, National Orchestra of Korea, Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra, New World Symphony, Portland Youth Philharmonic, Alarm Will Sound, Ensemble Intercontemporain, Ensemble Modern, AsianArt Ensemble Berlin, Ensemble Reconsil Vienna, New York Classical Players, Mendelssohn Chorus of Philadelphia, C4: Choral Composer-Conductor Collective, Verona Quartet, Red Clay Saxophone Quartet, Ensemble Mise-En, Eric Huebner, Blair McMillen, and Soyeon Kate Lee. In 2014-16, he served as the Composer-in-Residence of the Korean National Symphony Orchestra, and he currently directs its Composers’ Atelier program that commissions, mentors, and performs other Korean composers’ orchestral works.\nAn associate professor at San Diego State University, Kim has received awards and honors from the Barlow Prize, Civitella Ranieri Foundation, American Modern Ensemble, Copland House, SCI/ASCAP, Ilshin Composition Prize, and Isang Yun International Composition Prize, in addition to winning a Silver Medal in the 1998 International Chemistry Olympiad.

A bus will leave the hotel at 2PM and whisk you over to Lincoln Park to spend the afternoon in this wonderful space. The Legion opened in 1924 and its website describes it as home to “American art from the 17th century through today, textile arts and costumes, African art, Oceanic art, arts of the Americas, and international contemporary art.” The summer exhibition running then will be “Japanese Prints in Transition: From the Floating World to the Modern World.” For organists, an added bonus is that it is also home to the magnificent Spreckels Organ, built by the Ernest M. Skinner that opening year. Legion architect George Applegarth worked with Skinner to situate the instrument in the most imaginative way possible. Not only will you see it, but you’ll get to hear a free organ recital at 4 p.m. that afternoon by the Legion's Principal Organist Jonathan Dimmock, including Appalachian Triptych by David Hegarty, and music by Copland, Elgar, Halley, and Vaughan Williams.\n","id":"https://www.sfago2024.org/recitals/pre-convention-excursion-organ-recital-legion-of-honor-museum/","path":"/recitals/pre-convention-excursion-organ-recital-legion-of-honor-museum/","title":"Pre-Convention Excursion & Organ Recital: Legion of Honor Museum"},"https://www.sfago2024.org/recitals/shin-young-lee-olivier-latry-with-the-berkeley-symphony/":{"body":"Shin-Young Lee &amp; Olivier Latry with the Berkeley Symphony\nDate/Time\nTuesday, July 02, 2024\n08:00 PM – 09:30 PM\nPresenters\n\nOlivier Latry\nShin-Young Lee\nBerkeley Symphony\nJoseph Young\n\nDescription\nConcerto in One Movement for Organ and Chamber Orchestra (“Alaska”) — Emma Lou Diemer (b. 1927)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shin-Young Lee, organAscending Light for Organ and Orchestra — Michael Gandolfi (b. 1956)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Olivier Latry, organ&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ——Interval——Toccata Festiva for Organ and Orchestra — Samuel Barber (1910–1981)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shin-Young Lee, organThe Rite of Spring — Igor Stravinsky (1882–1971) (from the reduction for piano duet written by the composer)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shin-Young Lee &amp; Olivier Latry\n","id":"https://www.sfago2024.org/recitals/shin-young-lee-olivier-latry-with-the-berkeley-symphony/","path":"/recitals/shin-young-lee-olivier-latry-with-the-berkeley-symphony/","title":"Shin-Young Lee & Olivier Latry with the Berkeley Symphony"},"https://www.sfago2024.org/recitals/st-cecilia-recital-janette-fishell/":{"body":"St. Cecilia Recital: Janette Fishell\nDate/Time\nWednesday, July 03, 2024\n08:00 PM – 09:30 PM\nPresenters\n\nJanette Fishell\n\nDescription\nFrom Muse to MasterMuseFrom Cinq Improvisations (Reconstructed by Maurice Duruflé) — Charles Tournemire (1837-1939)&nbsp; &nbsp; Ave Maris StellaFrom Pièces de fantaisie (Dedicated to two of his female students) — Louis Vierne (1870-1937)&nbsp; &nbsp; Hymne au soleil, Op. 53, No. 3 (Dedicated to Madame Ruth M.

While many excellent published reharmonizations are available, the imaginative organist might want to explore ways of creating their own. This workshop introduces “progressive reharmonization,” a method of modifying and adding harmonic elements to a standard (hymnal) harmonization while avoiding chords that might confuse the singers. Topics covered will include the principles of traditional harmonic progression, how to introduce chords and non-harmonic elements that intensify those progressions, and how to use chords with harmonic extensions. No prior knowledge of advanced music theory is needed for this workshop.\n","id":"https://www.sfago2024.org/workshops/3-steps-to-your-own-hymn-reharmonizations/","path":"/workshops/3-steps-to-your-own-hymn-reharmonizations/","title":"3 Steps to Your Own Hymn Reharmonizations"},"https://www.sfago2024.org/workshops/7-steps-to-more-effective-hymn-playing/":{"body":"7 Steps to More Effective Hymn Playing\nDate/Time\nMonday, July 01, 2024\n10:00 AM – 10:45 AM\nPresenters\n\nTimothy Howard\n\nDescription\nGuiding a congregation to its corporate musical voice is one of an organist’s most important tasks, and how we approach playing hymns—the peoples’ music—is central to that. Too often, hymn playing can slip into mediocrity (leading the singing right along with it) when the organist only learns and executes the notes while not taking other important issues into account. This workshop presents a set of practical principles and achievable objectives you can use to help address those issues and turn ordinary hymn playing into an extraordinary experience for everyone. Topics covered will include tempo, phrasing, how “accuracy” and “perception” work together (or not), articulation, registration and more.\n","id":"https://www.sfago2024.org/workshops/7-steps-to-more-effective-hymn-playing/","path":"/workshops/7-steps-to-more-effective-hymn-playing/","title":"7 Steps to More Effective Hymn Playing"},"https://www.sfago2024.org/workshops/a-great-host-of-women-composers/":{"body":"A Great Host of Women Composers\nDate/Time\nMonday, July 01, 2024\n09:00 AM – 09:45 AM\nPresenters\n\nSusan Jane Matthews\n\nDescription\nFrom Fall 2020 through Spring 2023, A Great Host team of eight from diverse spots in the USA and England curated a database of sacred choral music by women composers for the three-year Revised Common Lectionary, viewable from www.greathostcomposers.org.

Special attention will be paid to developing a method of score analysis to aid conductors and singers in arriving at a deeper understanding of the formal architecture and content and their relation to text of the choral music they are performing, through practical application of tools of analysis and sight-singing, and applying those tools in the choral rehearsal.

These stories have the power to shake the world, and there’s no better instrument to bring those stories across the Pacific than the organ. \nThe organ will serve as a link between Eastern and Western traditions. Even though the body of Chinese music written for the organ is quite small, the instrument’s diverse array of sounds enables us to explore Chinese music written for orchestra, keyboard, and traditional Chinese instruments. \nRather than focusing on the history of the pipe organ in China, this session will focus on 19th and 20th century Chinese composers and their stories. Attendees will learn about these composers and the forces that shaped their pieces, and after each piece is introduced, Ms. Chiu will perform it. \nAttendees will not only walk away from this session with an increased knowledge of Chinese music and culture, but also an increased desire to diversify their repertoire.

This application for iOS allows users to store hundreds of thousands of scores, easily search and sort your music, and perform the music effectively in a live setting. Newer versions of iPads will even allow you to turn the page with simply a nod of the head. This workshop will focus on the process of taking your hard copy of a score, scanning each page and importing it into ForScore. From there, the music is given a label and appropriate tags. That music can then be put into a setlist and arranged in order with other scores. ForScore’s features include a built in metronome, audio recording capability, and shortcuts that can take you from any score to a specific page in the same score or a different score with the push of a button. ForScore allows you to mark, highlight, or write finger numbers or pedal markings into the score with a touch of your finger, and these markings can be easily erased. If you have an iPad, and you would like to incorporate it more into your music, this workshop will help you take those crucial steps into digitizing your library. With ForScore, you can carry your entire sheet music library with you at all times, and also backup those files so they will never be lost.\n","id":"https://www.sfago2024.org/workshops/from-ipad-to-organ-tech-tips/","path":"/workshops/from-ipad-to-organ-tech-tips/","title":"From iPad to Organ — Tech Tips"},"https://www.sfago2024.org/workshops/full-steam-ahead-new-world-for-new-organists/":{"body":"Full STEAM Ahead: New World for New Organists\nDate/Time\nMonday, July 01, 2024\n09:00 AM – 09:45 AM\nPresenters\n\nSue Mitchell-Wallace\nElizabeth George\n\nDescription\nSTEAM Resources are a new, expanding area of AGO’s national online resource hub: chapters can obtain and share ideas for inspiring new student organists.

You may have seen an increase in other musicians using tablets or other devices to read scores and mark scores and quickly turn pages. These tools can make playing the organ more efficient and can drastically reduce the amount of sheet music you carry with you on a regular basis. This workshop class will focus on the applications available for scanning and storing sheet music on a digital device, the applications available to view and perform music in real time, and devices that can help you turn pages with ease. With applications like ForScore and MobileSheets, you can store tens of thousands of scores, organize your digital libraries, and even highlight and mark your scores. You can easily search your array of collected scores by whatever criteria you choose, such as genre, key, composer, or any other user-defined tags. Beside sheet music reading, there are applications and devices for a variety of other uses, including metronomes, practice journals, audio and video recording, and virtual meeting software for teaching or taking lessons remotely. We will also examine note writing software, digital audio workstations for recording and editing music, and composition applications that can be used anywhere. We will broadly look at the available landscape of technology that helps organists focus on what matters most; making music effectively.\n","id":"https://www.sfago2024.org/workshops/getting-organized-with-technology/","path":"/workshops/getting-organized-with-technology/","title":"Getting Organized with Technology"},"https://www.sfago2024.org/workshops/getting-your-21st-century-congregation-to-love-the-organ-in-worship/":{"body":"Getting Your 21st-Century Congregation to Love the Organ in Worship\nDate/Time\nWednesday, July 03, 2024\n03:00 PM – 03:45 PM\nPresenters\n\nW.

When the railroads were promoting travel west in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, they used organ recitals to develop tourism and motivate people to ride the rails. Travel writers extolled the virtues of organs heard in concert. Railroad companies encouraged the development of recital series and organ demonstrations for tourists during their rail stops. Travel itineraries west to California often included a visit to the Tabernacle organ at Temple Square in Salt Lake City along with a visit to Yellowstone. A daily organ recital series at the Tabernacle was established during the golden age of rail travel and many cities followed suit with their own organ recital series. Organs became a status symbol of culture and refinement for western cities and organ recitals re-shaped the public’s perception of the “Wild West.”\n","id":"https://www.sfago2024.org/workshops/how-the-west-was-won-the-impact-of-railroad-tourism-on-organ-culture/","path":"/workshops/how-the-west-was-won-the-impact-of-railroad-tourism-on-organ-culture/","title":"How the West Was Won: The Impact of Railroad Tourism on Organ Culture"},"https://www.sfago2024.org/workshops/how-to-perform-brilliantly/":{"body":"How to Perform Brilliantly\nDate/Time\nTuesday, July 02, 2024\n09:00 AM – 09:45 AM\nPresenters\n\nAnne Marsden Thomas\n\nDescription\nWhy do so many organists find it hard to perform brilliantly?

Musicians are especially prone to this: studies indicate that 60–90% of musicians experience musculoskeletal pain that affects their playing at some point in their career, with surveys of organists indicating that most of us have or will experience some kind of playing-related discomfort in our careers. Awkward postures and tension are frequent contributors to this, but we can train ourselves to ‘check in’ on the state of and ways in which we are using our bodies to make changes that lead to better techniques or tension release. Concert organist Katelyn Emerson leads a workshop discussing fundamentals of detecting and adjusting for discomfort and tension in playing and in daily life based on her pedagogical work on injury prevention and recovery, studies in occupational ergonomics, and her own experience with playing-related injury.\n","id":"https://www.sfago2024.org/workshops/music-for-a-while-injury-prevention-for-organists-of-all-ages/","path":"/workshops/music-for-a-while-injury-prevention-for-organists-of-all-ages/","title":"Music for a While: Injury Prevention for Organists of All Ages"},"https://www.sfago2024.org/workshops/new-organ-chorales-in-the-schübler-tradition/":{"body":"“New” Organ Chorales in the Schübler Tradition\nDate/Time\nMonday, July 01, 2024\n09:00 AM – 09:45 AM\nPresenters\n\nMarilyn Perkins Biery\n\nDescription\nWhat if Bach had looked deeper into his cantata movements and prepared a second volume of his Schübler Chorales for organ? Bach’s original volume was published toward the end of his life (1747-1748), so perhaps he would have considered it if he had lived longer. Marilyn Biery looked through more than 200 of Bach’s cantatas, scanning for movements with a cantus firmus. She transcribed ten chorale-based Bach cantata movements in the same style as the Schübler Chorales, all but one in trio form, and with a similar symmetrical structure to Bach’s original collection. James Biery provided registration suggestions using specification of the Klais organ in Grosse Pointe Farms, MI as a starting point. Jim also recorded many of the movements, available to hear in this workshop and on the Augsburg website. Useful in worship or recital, each piece in the Augsburg book is accompanied by an explanation of its context in the original cantata and the chorale tune upon which it is based. They also make excellent pieces for organ instruction, especially for students who are not yet ready to learn an entire Bach trio sonata or for organists who love playing the trios but want something shorter for worship services. Several of the tunes in this volume are tunes in current use, including Jesu, meine Freude, Lobe den Herren, Valet will ich dir geben and Christ lag in Todesbanden.\n","id":"https://www.sfago2024.org/workshops/new-organ-chorales-in-the-schübler-tradition/","path":"/workshops/new-organ-chorales-in-the-schübler-tradition/","title":"“New” Organ Chorales in the Schübler Tradition"},"https://www.sfago2024.org/workshops/organ-concerts-at-san-francisco-s-world-s-fair/":{"body":"Organ Concerts at San Francisco’s World’s Fair\nDate/Time\nWednesday, July 03, 2024\n02:00 PM – 02:45 PM\nPresenters\n\nAnne Laver\n\nDescription\nFrom February to December 1915, San Francisco welcomed 18 million visitors to the highly successful Panama-Pacific International Exposition (PPIE). Situated on 600 acres of waterfront in what is today’s marina district, this impressive world’s fair commemorating the completion of the Panama Canal offered visitors a myriad of exhibits relating to industry, technology, and the arts. One of the exhibits was a new organ built by the Austin Organ Company the exposition’s Festival Hall. The organ was used for daily concerts by the day’s leading organists, including the British virtuoso Edwin H. Lemare, who played 100 concerts over the course of six weeks. \nIn this period of history, the pipe organ stood at the intersection of industry, technology, culture, and commerce, and it epitomized the spirit of progress that was so intrinsic to U.S. world’s fairs. Organ series were an important feature of the music programs at the expositions in Chicago, Buffalo, and St. Louis, and San Francisco’s event followed those models. These events introduced the organ to a general audience and paved the way for a golden age of civic organ building and culture in this country. \nDrawing on archival research in UCLA Berkeley’s Bancroft Library and publications by Austin Opus 500 expert Justin Kielty, this presentation will share the fascinating story of the PPIE organ series while placing it in the larger context of world’s fair scholarship and the history of the pipe organ in the U.S.\n","id":"https://www.sfago2024.org/workshops/organ-concerts-at-san-francisco-s-world-s-fair/","path":"/workshops/organ-concerts-at-san-francisco-s-world-s-fair/","title":"Organ Concerts at San Francisco’s World’s Fair"},"https://www.sfago2024.org/workshops/organ-music-by-women-composers/":{"body":"Organ Music by Women Composers\nDate/Time\nWednesday, July 03, 2024\n03:00 PM – 03:45 PM\nPresenters\n\nAnne Marsden Thomas\n\nDescription\nWomen composers are at last beginning to emerge from centuries of neglect.

You’ll learn about the evolution of the Castro’s architecture, historic businesses, and the people and places that played a role in making the Castro one of the epicenters of the gay rights movement—a tradition that continues to this day.NOTE: This is a 3-hour session.

The relationship between the 8- and 4-foot principals on each division, for example, helps define an organ’s very nature. Comparing the full principal choruses within and between organs sheds even more light.\nFor the research behind this presentation, historic and modern organs were selected from builders in Germany (Schnitger, Silbermann, Trost, Ladegast, Vleugels), France (Cavaille-Coll, Clicquot) and America (Hook, Aeolean-Skinner, Fisk, Letourneau, Schoenstein). Good-quality recordings of a C-major arpeggio played on every stop were made from a central seat in the audience. Also, the same four bars of music were recorded on common combinations, and each mixture was played chromatically from bottom to top. These recordings are now available free online on the Pipe Organ Stop Library.\nMany interesting details emerge from side-by-side hearings of sound clips and from line graphs of the intensity (volume) levels from bottom to top of each stop. During the workshop we will discuss and hear some of the most compelling of these comparisons. Using the Library in this manner can be of great value to organists as they register their pieces, and to organ builders and voicers as they create their instruments.\n","id":"https://www.sfago2024.org/workshops/the-new-pipe-organ-stop-library/","path":"/workshops/the-new-pipe-organ-stop-library/","title":"The New Pipe Organ Stop Library"},"https://www.sfago2024.org/workshops/the-rest-of-the-story/":{"body":"“The Rest of the Story…”\nDate/Time\nWednesday, July 03, 2024\n02:00 PM – 02:45 PM\nPresenters\n\nFaythe Freese\n\nDescription\nAnecdotal stories!&nbsp; Dr. Freese discusses her commissioning of The Freese Collection by Pamela Decker and Nall artwork, the inspiration for The Freese Collection.

A first step is to feature the instrument in a variety of textures, from single stops rendered with delicacy to full ensembles played with virtuosic bravura.  Demonstrating the organ’s capabilities is an important aspect of programming.\nAnother vital consideration is the variety of style and genre in the program. To achieve this heterogeneity, there is much material available since the organ has a vast repertoire, the largest of any modern musical instrument. Sharing arcane gems of early or contemporary music can help to attract and hold listeners’ attention, by introducing them to something novel. The lesser-known can provide a larger historical or cultural context for more frequently played works so that they are heard in new ways. \nThis workshop will explore creative principles of programming with specific examples designed to help organists as they design concerts to both please and astonish their audiences. Kimberly Marshall will use this opportunity to describe how she formulated her program for the final concert of the convention, on the Murray Harris and Fisk organs at Stanford’s Memorial Church.\n","id":"https://www.sfago2024.org/workshops/to-please-and-to-astonish-creative-programming/","path":"/workshops/to-please-and-to-astonish-creative-programming/","title":"“To Please and to Astonish”: Creative Programming"},"https://www.sfago2024.org/workshops/transylvanian-organ-landscape-historic-organ-restoration-in-romania/":{"body":"Transylvanian Organ Landscape: Historic Organ Restoration in Romania\nDate/Time\nTuesday, July 02, 2024\n09:00 AM – 09:45 AM\nPresenters\n\nRenée Anne Louprette\nÁrpád Magyar\n\nDescription\nThis workshop, co-presented by concert organist Renée Anne Louprette and organ builder Árpád Magyar, will present a summary of Ms. Louprette’s 2022 Fulbright research project surveying historic pipe organs throughout Romania.

Obviously, it is not the same tonal realm of Bach or his predecessors. Moreover, it is also not comparable to the sound world of Franck, Tournemire, or even Messiaen.\nMy research has provided fascinating insights based on the analysis of Vierne’s works from his 24 Pièces de Fantaisie and the Scherzo from his 6th Symphony. The presentation will focus on four selections: Cathédrales, Toccata, Fantômes, and the Scherzo. I will focus on the harmonic language of various sections of these selected pieces, rather than discuss a full analysis of each work. This presentation will highlight Vierne’s usage of the Modes of Limited Transposition (prior to Messiaen’s codification), in conjunction with the Gregorian Modes, and traditional harmony. This presentation will be of interest to both performers and enthusiasts of Vierne’s organ music.\n","id":"https://www.sfago2024.org/workshops/vierne-s-harmonic-language/","path":"/workshops/vierne-s-harmonic-language/","title":"Vierne's Harmonic Language"},"https://www.sfago2024.org/workshops/visionary-leadership-chapter-officer-training/":{"body":"Visionary Leadership: Chapter Officer Training\nDate/Time\nSunday, June 30, 2024\n03:30 PM – 05:00 PM\nDescription\nAre you prepared to serve on your board?&nbsp;Referencing&nbsp;The Board Team Handbook, this interactive workshop that is open to anyone serving on a chapter board, will address your role and responsibilities, and the essential skills needed to work successfully as a team.\n","id":"https://www.sfago2024.org/workshops/visionary-leadership-chapter-officer-training/","path":"/workshops/visionary-leadership-chapter-officer-training/","title":"Visionary Leadership: Chapter Officer Training"},"https://www.sfago2024.org/workshops/visit-to-sfmoma-sold-out/":{"body":"Visit to SFMOMA - SOLD OUT!\nDate/Time\nWednesday, July 03, 2024\n02:00 PM – 04:00 PM\nDescription\nThe San Francisco Museum of Modern Art holds an internationally recognized collection of modern and contemporary art, and was the first museum on the West Coast devoted solely to 20th-century art.
